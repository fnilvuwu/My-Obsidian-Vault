"OK, the keys are not here..."

Then we had our complete `attention on searching` for the keys. However, what if we are in a hurry?

Then we look at our watch every 5 seconds, and our thoughts are already on where we expected to be soon. We will hardly be able to `concentrate` on the search for the keys because your focus is on "**being late**" and not on "`finding the keys`." It should have become clearer that [[Focus]] and [[Attention]] are not the same and that attention is influenced by focus.

The focus is based on our will and what we want to achieve. It can be a `conscious decision` and a `subconscious decision` guided by external influences.

`Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal`.
